title: 'The eRocket'
---

There is an increasing demand for fast drone deliv-eries for both consumer’s necessities and medical emergencies.In addition to improving delivery, there have been manydevelopments within space research aiming to reduce global cost.Reusable rockets are regarded as the future of space travel,however, numerous accidents have been observed during landing,making these rockets an unreliable resource for experimentation. This new benchmark system is a reliable platform. It mainly embeds drone and model making components on an electric thrust vectored rocket architecture.

Under its state conditions and using Newton's laws, the equations of motion approximate an inverted pendulum.

It as then been simulated on MATLAB.

As a proof of concept, a real prototype is under development.
