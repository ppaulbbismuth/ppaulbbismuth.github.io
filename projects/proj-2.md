title: 'The Hive Tracker'
---

This project is about a miniaturization of the Vive Tracker by HTC. It allows sub-millimetric 3d positioning at scale, and embeds a 9DoF IMU with sensor fusion. The <a href="https://github.com/HiveTracker">repository</a> shows several developments and documented test bricks.

On this project, I have first simulate the Hive Tracker on a game engine.

(Add gif blender game engine)

I have then implemented the mathematical principle of the HTC Vive localisation principle. As we want it to be open source, we used Blender for 3D virtuam representation.
