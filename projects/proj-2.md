title: 'The Hive Tracker'

This project is about a miniaturization of the Vive Tracker by HTC. It allows sub-millimetric 3d positioning at scale, and embeds a 9DoF IMU with sensor fusion. The <a href="https://github.com/HiveTracker">repository</a> shows several developments and documented test bricks.
