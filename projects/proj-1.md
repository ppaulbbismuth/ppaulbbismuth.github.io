title: 'Fast Autonomous Drone Landing Master Thesis'
---
There is an increasing demand for fast drone deliveries for both consumerâ€™s necessities and medical emergencies. All aircraft are subject to landing difficulties because of near-ground aerodynamic effects and complications with moving from air to land. In addition to improving delivery, there have been many developments within space research aiming to reduce global cost. Reusable rockets are regarded as the future of space travel, however, numerous accidents have been observed during landing, making these rockets an unreliable resource for experimentation. The standard approach for both drone delivery and reusable rockets requires speed reduction before landing, as explained by the lack of precision of the embedded sensors combined with the fragility of the frame. The landing shock thus needs to be attenuated to deform irremediably the frame structure. Therefore there is a need for improvement of landing approach for more reliability. The main research contents of this thesis cover different areas forthe development of a newly designed electric thrust vectored rocket that aims to incorporate afast landing approach using this new benchmark system.
