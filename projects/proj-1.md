title: 'Fast Autonomous Drone Landing Master Thesis'
---
There is an increasing demand for fast drone deliveries for both consumerâ€™s necessitiesand medical emergencies. All aircraft are subject to landing difficulties because of near-groundaerodynamic effects and complications with moving from air to land. In addition to improvingdelivery, there have been many developments within space research aiming to reduce globalcost. Reusable rockets are regarded as the future of space travel, however, numerous accidentshave been observed during landing, making these rockets an unreliable resource for experi-mentation. The standard approach for both drone delivery and reusable rockets requires speedreduction before landing, as explained by the lack of precision of the embedded sensors com-bined with the fragility of the frame. The landing shock thus needs to be attenuated to deformirremediably the frame structure. Therefore there is a need for improvement of landing ap-proach for more reliability. The main research contents of this thesis cover different areas forthe development of a newly designed electric thrust vectored rocket that aims to incorporate afast landing approach using this new benchmark system.
